# Serverless Framework Node HTTP API on AWS

I have deployed and practiced this project on how to make a simple HTTP API with Node.js running on AWS Lambda and API Gateway using the Serverless Framework.This was an awesome experience with serverless techonology. 

This API does not include any kind of persistence (database).
